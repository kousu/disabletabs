<h1>Firefox SDK target=_blank event listener bug</h1>
<p><code>windows.on('open')</code> doesn't catch new tabs/pages made with a target set.</p>
<p>Try opening <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/policies/reviews#section-binary" target="_blank">this link</a> in a new tab, and then by clicking on it, and compare the output from the extension.</p>.
