    // They will be signed if uploaded to addons.mozilla.org -- once they've been manually reviewed by humans,
    // or you can automate it if you get an API key from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/api/key/.
    // It is not clear to me if it is possible to self-sign with a manually installed CA, or if you *must* use Mozilla's root key.
    // It seems that Mozilla's plan is for Firefox to fragment into user and developer editions:
    //  the former requiring signatures,
    //  the latter with extra options, in particular xpinstall.signatures.required
    // which is unfortunate and not very DIY friendly.
